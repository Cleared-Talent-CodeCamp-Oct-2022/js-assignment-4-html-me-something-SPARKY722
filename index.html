   <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I was honored to take this difficult task after, being voluntold by a very on-edge Master Chief.
      His words of encoragment still ring in my ears it felt like it was yesterday. His promising
      words, <b>"You Screw This UP, I'll bury YOU!"</b>
      The plan was moving ## Strike Fighter aircraft and ### personel with tons of gear in a short
      period of time from Atsugi, Japan to Fallon, Nevada in two weeks. The distance we are moving
      the unit covers 5,258 miles. This was all in due part of a move to the left in our deployment
      schedule. I was looking at two battle fronts, coordinating the move of jets, pilots and
      maintance crew and the other was admin and maintenace personel with gear.
      We'll start off with personel and gear, sinse that usally takes the longest. Getting all the
      squadrons to work with each other is a chanllenge but once they figure out they can finish early
      and go home, then they're all in,"One team One Fight.class="</p>

   <p>Now it's time to get the gear inspected and ready to ready to shipout to our Air Force brothers.
      The inspections are pretty intense, they go through every box to ensure saftey of gear and personel.
      Let's be honest, the last place you want to have a fire is on a aircraft 30,0000 feet in the air
      and full of fuel. The expectd aircraft to take on this long trip is the KC-10. Have to say this aircraft is able
      to handle personel, maintance gear, and most importantly fuel our Fighter jets in the sky.

   <p>Now with the gear ready to ship-out, we have to ensure the drivers have all the information
      needed along with contact infomration just in case they get lost. The next transistion, is
      the best. It has a catigory all of it's own. This is the majic show, trying to get all
      personnel accounted for with personnel gear in tow. Getting everyone on the flight with
      no issues is a struggle but we are able to get it done without a hitch.

   <p>Last piece, all that is left is planning the Air Force to launch off at the same time as our
      Fighter jets. I have to say this was very stressful, only because once we had all our jets
      ready to fly the KC-10 was late due to a flight control issue. If by chance the KC-10 didn't
      go, we would have to move all the gear and personnel to the other jet and re-inspect the gear
      once again. Good thing everything work-out!
